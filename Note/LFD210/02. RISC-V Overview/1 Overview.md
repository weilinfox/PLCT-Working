# Overview

## Chapter Introduction

In this chapter, you will get acquainted with RISC-V. Please note that you are expected to already be familiar with computer architecture and to have some exposure to some specific ISA. We will provide some refreshers on basic terms, but this is certainly not an introduction to computer architecture.

Among the topics we will cover, you will learn about the history of RISC-V and how it differs from todayâ€™s dominating ISAs. You will also get the chance to browse through the vast documentation of RISC-V, and you will learn how the documents are organized.

You will be introduced to RISC-V International and the RISC-V ecosystem, and you will learn about quite a few different ways you may contribute to the RISC-V community.

Let us get started!

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

+ Understand what RISC-V is and what it is not.
+ Identify the characteristics of an ISA to decide whether it is a CISC or a RISC type ISA.
+ Describe the history of RISC-V.
+ Identify the most notable differences between RISC-V and the leading commercial ISAs, like x86 and ARM.
+ Understand the structure and operation of RISC-V International.
+ Analyze the documentation of RISC-V specifications.
+ Explore ways to contribute to the RISC-V effort.
