## Chapter 2 Quiz

Congratulations on completing *Chapter 2 - RISC-V Overview*. Take this quiz to check your understanding of the concepts you've learned about so far.

+ Question 2.1

  Which of the following is closest to the year when the RISC architecture was first proposed?

  A. 1970

  B. 1980

  C. 1990

  D. 2010

+ Question 2.2

  Which of the following is closest to the year when the RISC-V project began?

  A. 1970

  B. 1980

  C. 1990

  D. 2010

+ Question 2.3

  What does RISC stand for?

  A. Real Instruction Simple Computing

  B. Reduced Instruction Set Computer

  C. Register Instruction Stack Computer

  D. Raw Implementation of Source Code

+ Question 2.4

  Which of the following is a trait of the RISC architecture?

  A. Memory access is limited to Load and Store instructions.

  B. The CPU contains only a few general purpose registers.

  C. Most instructions have access to memory.

  D. The instruction set is very dense.

+ Question 2.5

  RISC-V is the first open RISC ISA.

  True/False

  A. True

  B. False

+ Question 2.6

  What does it mean to say that RISC-V uses a modular rather than incremental design?

  A. The ISA consists of a combination of a base ISA and a set of ISA extensions.

  B. The ISA consists of a series of incremental variants where each one includes the previous design, plus some additions.

  C. The ISA consists of optional blocks like the ALU, Register File, Datapath, and so on.

  D. Actually, the RISC-V ISA uses an incremental design.

+ Question 2.7

  What happens if a RISC-V processor fetches code with instructions from extensions that are missing in the physical CPU?

  A. A fatal exception occurs and the execution of instructions cannot continue.

  B. An exception occurs, which the software must handle to take some action like emulating the instruction.

  C. This situation cannot occur because the compiler guarantees that the generated code will only include instructions supported by the target CPU.

  D. The unsupported instructions are simply ignored, doing the same as a NOP instruction would do.

+ Question 2.8

  Which of the following is **NOT** a lifecycle status to indicate the level of maturity of a RISC-V ISA specification?

  A. Finalized

  B. Frozen

  C. Open

  D. Ratified

+ Question 2.9

  How is the RISC-V manual divided into its two volumes?

  A. Volume 1 covers the ratified ISA specifications, and volume 2 covers the open and frozen ISA specifications.

  B. Volume 1 covers the base ISAs, and volume 2 covers the ISA extensions.

  C. Volume 1 covers the unprivileged ISA, and volume 2 covers the privileged ISA.

  D. Actually, the RISC-V manual consists of one single volume.

+ Question 2.10

  What is the main difference between the x86 and RISC-V ISAs?

  A. RISC-V has more addressing modes than x86.

  B. x86 is a CISC ISA, while RISC-V is a RISC ISA.

  C. x86 has much more general purpose CPU registers than RISC-V.

  D. x86 has less instructions than RISC-V.

+ Question 2.11

  How is it possible for RISC ISAs like those by ARM to be so different from RISC-V?

  A. ARM ISAs have been influenced by industry demands in a similar way as CISC ISAs were in the 1970s.

  B. ARM ISAs are based on the CISC philosophy.

  C. ARM ISAs are exclusively intended for embedded applications.

  D. Actually, all RISC ISAs are very similar.

+ Question 2.12

  Who owns and regulates the RISC-V ISA?

  A. ARM Holdings

  B. Intel Corporation

  C. RISC-V International

  D. Nobody owns RISC-V, and anyone can modify the specification.

+ Question 2.13

  Which of the following is **NOT** a way to contribute to RISC-V?

  A. Contributing to maintain the specifications on GitHub.

  B. Actually, contribution to RISC-V is not open to the general public.

  C. Proposing new instructions to the existing RISC-V base ISAs or any of the ISA extensions.

  D. Using the RISC-V ISA in your hardware and paying royalties to RISC-V International for its use.
